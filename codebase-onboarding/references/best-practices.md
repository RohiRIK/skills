# Best Practices

1. **Don't read everything** — reconnaissance should use Glob and Grep, not Read on every file. Read selectively only for ambiguous signals.
2. **Verify, don't guess** — if a framework is detected from config but the actual code uses something different, trust the code.
3. **Respect existing CLAUDE.md** — if one already exists, enhance it rather than replacing it. Call out what's new vs existing.
4. **Stay concise** — the onboarding guide should be scannable in 2 minutes. Details belong in the code, not the guide.
5. **Flag unknowns** — if a convention can't be confidently detected, say so rather than guessing. "Could not determine test runner" is better than a wrong answer.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Generating a CLAUDE.md that's longer than 100 lines — keep it focused
- Listing every dependency — highlight only the ones that shape how you write code
- Describing obvious directory names — `src/` doesn't need an explanation
- Copying the README — the onboarding guide adds structural insight the README lacks
